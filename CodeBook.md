#CodeBook

This table contains the averages of various measurements of accelerometer and gyroscope collected from a Samsung Galaxy S II by 30 volunteers as they performed certain activites.  

##Variables

The table contains 68 variables. The first two represent the subject and the acitivity being performed. All the others are the measurements being made.

subjectId : Integer to represent the participants in the experiment. Range from 1 to 30

activity : Factor to represent the activity being performed by the participant at the time of measurement. The values can be 	WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

66 numeric variables that depict the averages of the mean and standard deviation of the measurements made. In this case the word "Time" indicates a time domain signal and the word "Frequency"" indicates a frequency domain signal.
The exact variables are listed below.
